I might not even be allowed to put words here, But I need some notes taken:

to run a program I wirte in user/ directory, step out of that directory, and sudo make qemu, and inside the new terminal just type the name of the file without file extension, such as hello. When I want to quit, press ctrl+a , then just press x

for the first homework whereby I essentially need a dynamic buffer, need to implement it the way like a python list (doubling of size), also when read in arguments, read one by one instead of doing all of them at once.



More notes after mon office hour:

user functions such as read() are stored in sysfile.c inside kernel. They all have names like sys_foo(), but to call them you just call foo().

cat() is a great example of both reading in file and stdinput, also I misinterpreted std input!

need to use printf to print out sorted number!

the starter code is good place holder!

try the implementation with a fake shadow program in myabe python, which i think will help greatly.

Still need to think about what happens when trying to read from file, because data comes in as bytes of chars

read very carefully the behaviour of read. read has changing values apparently, as it returns the size of data you read in.
